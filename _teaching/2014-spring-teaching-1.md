As an Academic Support Volunteer at Make a Difference (MAD), an NGO dedicated to 
empowering underprivileged students, I had the privilege of teaching Math and Science to 
9th and 10th-grade students. It was an immensely rewarding experience to support these 
bright young minds and foster their love for learning. Through interactive lessons, personalized attention, and mentoring, I aimed to provide a solid foundation in these subjects, enabling 
them to excel academically. Witnessing their growth and witnessing their passion for knowledge 
bloom was truly inspiring. My time with MAD has not only honed my teaching skills but has also 
deepened my commitment to making a difference in the lives of underprivileged youth. I am proud 
to have been a part of this transformative journey and look forward to continuing 
my pursuit of educational empowerment.
