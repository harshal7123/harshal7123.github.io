## 1. Major Project College - Modelling and Simulation of Ground Source Heat Pump.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Abstract:
As global living standards, economic growth, and population continue to rise, the demand for cooling and air conditioning is set to surge in the next 30 years. Currently, refrigeration and air conditioning account for around 17% of global energy consumption, equivalent to approximately 2000 TWh. Without improvements in energy efficiency or the introduction of new technologies, electricity usage could triple by 2050. 


 Our project aims to simulate Ground Source Heat Pumps, which enhance the effectiveness of heat pumps and significantly increase energy savings. By optimizing the operation of these heat pumps, we can help address the growing demand for cooling and Heating while minimizing energy consumption.

## 2. [Project](https://github.com/harshal7123/FCC_challenges) - Image Classification using Deep Learning.

• Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs.
• Preprocessed the images using data augmentation techniques and trained the model on a dataset of 2000
images with 70 epochs.
• Achieved an accuracy of 76% on the test set.
